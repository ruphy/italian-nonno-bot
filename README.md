## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Telegram account (you'll use your personal account, not a bot token)
- OpenRouter API key (for accessing AI models like Gemini Flash 1.5)
- Basic familiarity with Python and command line

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruphy/italian-nonno-bot.git
   cd italian-nonno-bot
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Get Telegram API credentials**
   - Visit [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
   - Log in with your phone number
   - Click "API development tools"
   - Create a new application (choose any name/description)
   - Copy your `api_id` and `api_hash`

4. **Get OpenRouter API key**
   - Visit [https://openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
   - Create an account or log in
   - Generate an API key
   - Add some credits to your account (Gemini 2.0 Flash is very affordable)

5. **Configure the bot**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example configuration
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your favorite text editor
   nano .env  # or vim, code, etc.
   ```
   
   Fill in your credentials:
   - `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` from step 3
   - `TELEGRAM_PHONE_NUMBER` (your phone number with country code)
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from step 4
   - Customize `BOT_PERSONALITY` to match your desired character

6. **First-time authentication (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Optional: Authenticate separately for cleaner setup
   python auth.py
   ```
   
   Or authenticate during first run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
   On first run, you'll need to:
   - Enter the verification code sent to your phone
   - Select which Telegram group to monitor
   - Watch as your Italian nonno comes to life! üéâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The bot is highly customizable through the `.env` file:

### Personality Settings
- `BOT_PERSONALITY`: Define your character's personality (Italian grandfather by default)
- `AI_MODEL`: OpenRouter model to use (default: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp`)

### Behavior Settings  
- `CONTEXT_MESSAGES`: Number of previous messages to remember (default: 20)
- `RESPONSE_DELAY_MIN/MAX`: Thinking time before responding (1-3 seconds)
- `RATE_LIMIT_MESSAGES`: Maximum messages per minute (default: 10)

### Safety Settings
- `IGNORE_BOTS`: Whether to ignore other bots (recommended: `true`)

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Start the bot**: `python main.py`
2. **First-time setup**: Enter phone verification code
3. **Group selection**: Choose from your available groups (sorted by activity)
4. **Enjoy**: Watch your Italian nonno charm the group! 

**To stop**: Press `Ctrl+C`

## üîê Security & Privacy

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes:**
- Your Telegram session is stored locally in `.session` files
- **Never commit your `.env` file** - it contains your credentials
- The bot uses your personal Telegram account (be mindful of ToS)
- Rate limiting prevents spam detection
- All data stays local - no external servers involved

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No groups found" | Make sure you're in at least one group/supergroup |
| Authentication fails | Delete `.session` files and restart |
| AI not responding | Check your OpenRouter API key and credits |
| Rate limit errors | Adjust `RATE_LIMIT_MESSAGES` in `.env` |
| Bot seems too active | Increase delay times or reduce response probability |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **`main.py`**: Core bot logic and message handling
- **`telegram_client.py`**: Telegram MTProto integration  
- **`claude_handler.py`**: AI model interaction via OpenRouter
- **`config.py`**: Configuration management
- **`auth.py`**: Authentication helpers
